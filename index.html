<h3>Welcome to the Chun lab</h3>

The Chun Lab is a computational genetics laboratory in the <a href="https://www.childrenshospital.org/departments/pulmonary-medicine">Division of Pulmonary Medicine</a> at <a href="https://www.childrenshospital.org/">Boston Children's Hospital</a> and Department of Pediatrics at <a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/">Harvard Medical School</a>. We are interested in the development of novel computational methods for integrative genetic analysis and their application to rare and common pulmonary genetic disorders. Chun Lab is supported by NHLBI (1R56HL171620).
