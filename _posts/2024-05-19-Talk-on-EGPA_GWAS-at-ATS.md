![EGPA GWAS](/sungchunlab/EGPA.jpg){: width="300" .callout} Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a rare anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis characterized by eosinophilia and severe asthma. We conducted a Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) of EGPA in a total of 928 cases and 11,266 controls of European ancestry. We present our findings at the annual meeting of American Thoracic Society (Session A102. EVALUATING THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN AUTOIMMUNITY, IMMUNODEFICIENCY, AND INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASES) [Abstract](https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1164/ajrccm-conference.2024.209.1_MeetingAbstracts.A2809).
