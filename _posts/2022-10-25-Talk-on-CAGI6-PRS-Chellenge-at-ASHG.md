title: Talk on CAGI6 PRS Challenge at ASHG
---

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have potential clinical utility for risk surveillance, prevention and personalized medicine. To assess the current state of the field and stimulate the cross-polination of new ideas, we organized [a community challenge for polygenic risk prediction](http://genomeinterpretation.org/cagi6-prs.html) as part of [Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation (CAGI)](https://genomeinterpretation.org/) 6 program. Sung served as a Co-assessor to this challenge and will discuss the finding from CAGI6 PRS challenge at ASHG 2022 (Session S09, Invited Talk 053). Slides are available [here](https://sgchun.github.io/sungchunlab/20221006-ASHG-CAGI6.pdf).
