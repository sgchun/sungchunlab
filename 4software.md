| [Joint Likelihood Mapping (JLIM)](https://github.com/cotsapaslab/jlim) | JLIM is a cross-trait test for shared causal effect described in [Chun et al. Nature Genetics 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3795). JLIM tests whether two traits – primary and secondary – are driven by shared causal effect or not. Typically, the primary trait is a large GWAS study, and the secondary trait is an expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) association study. The latest version is 2.5. | 
| [Non-Parametric Shrinkage (NPS)](https://github.com/sgchun/nps) | NPS implements a non-parametric polygenic risk prediction algorithm described in [Chun and Imakaev et al. Am J of Hum Genet 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929720301518?via%3Dihub). NPS transforms genetic data into an orthogonal domain called "eigenlocus space" and learns conditional mean effects by partitioning genetic variations into trenches and measuring the predictive power of each trench in an independent training cohort. The latest version is 1.1. |
